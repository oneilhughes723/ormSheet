        <br>
        <p> Crews will fill out the required information on the top of the RM
            card. The Ops SUP and duty dog will initial the "SUP" and "Logged"
            blocks respectively. If an O&B, crews will fill  out two ORM sheets,
            one with their scheduled takeoff time and another with their planned
            takeoff time out of the outbase. Assign a point value to each row of
            risk factors as appropriate, the highest value for each row will be
            recorded. For Health & Stress/Fatigue, use the matricies below.
            Each crew member will tally their points and determine their overall
            score rating, the highest member on the crew will drive the value
            taken on the RM card. (e.g. a crew member scores 5 on fatigue which
            correlates to a MODERATE, this will drive a MODERATE on the RM card)
            Tally all scores on the RM card to determine appropriate level.
